## Introduction
This project demonstrates a real-time data processing pipeline using Kafka and Docker. The pipeline ingests streaming data from a Kafka topic, processes the data, and stores the processed data in another Kafka topic. The setup includes Docker containers for Kafka and Zookeeper, as well as a data generator that produces messages to a Kafka topic (in the docker-compose itself), or a manual producer.py,

### File Descriptions
- **client.py**: Contains helper functions to create Kafka producer and consumer clients.
- **consumer.py**: Consumes messages from a Kafka topic, processes them, and produces them to another Kafka topic.
- **producer.py**: A standalone script for producing messages to a Kafka topic (used if needed).
- **admin.py**: Contains functions to create and list Kafka topics.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose file to set up Kafka, Zookeeper, and the data generator.
- **README.md**: This file.


## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Installation Steps
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   docker-compose up -d
   docker ps
   python consumer.py
   ```

### Additional Questions

**1. How would you deploy this application in production?**
   - Use Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage Docker containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and the consumer.
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and updates.
   - Set up monitoring and alerting using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.

**2. What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?**
   - Monitoring and logging infrastructure.
   - Kafka Connect for integrating with other data sources and sinks.
   - Schema registry for managing and validating data schemas.
   - Robust error handling and alerting mechanisms.

**3. How can this application scale with a growing dataset?**
   - Increase Kafka partitions to distribute the data more evenly across consumers.
   - Add more consumer instances to the consumer group to parallelize data processing.
   - Utilize auto-scaling features in Kubernetes to dynamically scale the number of containers based on load.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates setting up a real-time data processing pipeline using Kafka and Docker. The provided setup and scripts enable efficient data ingestion, processing, and storage. For a production environment, additional components and scaling strategies can be implemented to ensure robustness and scalability.
